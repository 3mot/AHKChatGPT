# AHKChatGPT
An AHK utility for interacting with ChatGPT written by me. Pretty simple to access an API with AHK but this could definitely use some work because parsing responses I get in different languages or certain special characters have issues an I am too dumb to fix it.

Please provide feedback! You must have your own API key to use and you can hardcode it in if you want but I wasn't giving mine away for free
